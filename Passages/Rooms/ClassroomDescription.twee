The classroom was the next stop on my journey. A copious amount of desks were scattered throughout the room. It gave me a very “young” crowd feeling. There were many parts of the room that gave this away. Firstly the colorful drawings layered on the walls, the large box of what appeared to be crayons, and the fun looking sandbox that sat next to the door to the hallway.
