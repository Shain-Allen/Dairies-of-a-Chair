The gymnasium was a fun excursion for me. There were a lot of interesting things to look at. I had found a lot of different equipment pieces in the closet attached to the gym. There was a net bag with lots of balls, I found what appeared to be a goal for some game, and some heavy weights that looked dusty laying in the corner.
