:: Clearners {"position":"1600,600"}
You feel a bit soiled after what felt like a long week. You reach out to the guru to get a good cleaning. You need to appear polished going into this next week. Otherwise no one may want to sit on you. 

“A cleaning, aye? What a good choice! You’ll find more people would rather sit on a polished chair! Now of course I can’t give a good cleaning away for free. You’s got somethin you’d be willing to trade?
