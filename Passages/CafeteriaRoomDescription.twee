As I had approached the cafeteria, it was exactly what you would have expected. There were lots of tables and chairs put up as the janitors had to clean. I scrounged the ground, but the eating area was fresh out of anything useful. Just a few crumbs of food missed in the corners. I did manage to make my way back to the kitchen and there were so many trays, that a few of them took a spill to the floor.
