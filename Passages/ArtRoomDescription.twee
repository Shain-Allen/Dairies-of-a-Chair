Today I made my way into the art room,  I saw lots of eye catching canvasâ€™ around the room. The walls were filled with colorful art pieces, all appeared to be different kinds. I saw abstract, landscape pieces, portraits, and more. There were groups of empty tables throughout the room. What appeared to be the teacher's desk sat in the corner farthest from the door.
